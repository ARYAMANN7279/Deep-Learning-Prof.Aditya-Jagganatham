DEEP LEARNING-PROF.ADITYA JAGGANATHAM


This repository hosts the complete implementation of my course project conducted under the guidance of Professor Aditya Jagannatham, as part of a comprehensive study on Deep Learning. The project encompasses the application of various deep learning architectures and techniques across a diverse set of benchmark datasets, including:

MNIST – for handwritten digit classification

IMDB – for sentiment analysis using neural networks

California Housing – for real estate price prediction using regression techniques

Boston Housing – for evaluating housing prices using classic regression models

Each notebook in this repository is well-documented, showcasing end-to-end model development including data preprocessing, model building, training, validation, and evaluation. The work demonstrates the effectiveness of neural networks in solving both classification and regression tasks using real-world datasets.

This repository stands as a culmination of theoretical understanding and practical implementation, reflecting the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course.
